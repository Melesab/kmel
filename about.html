                    <h1>About Kidmel Blogging Site</h1>
                    <p>
                        Kidmel Blogging Site was developed as part of a school project work for the course 
                        Introduction to Web Development in Jönköping University by Meles Kidane. 
                        <br>
                        During the launch of the website, the first blog entries will be about education and 
                        learning. Of course, as being a student, the author would love to reflect some of his 
                        personal experiences which can relate to each one us. Being at school or in out daily 
                        life activities, we engage ourselves in some kind of learning process, the same way a 
                        one-year old child learns to walk and use words. Apart from the above-mentioned topic, 
                        the author would also like to mention here some worth discussing topics. Those topics 
                        could be about individual internal peace, aiming for maximal mental health, and destructive 
                        habits that are very common these days in majority of us. 
                        <br>
                        As a reader, users can enjoy the wide details presentation of the blog entry topics as 
                        well as engage themselves in communicating back through feedbacks. Feedbacks are going 
                        to be only very few words, but if more than one sentence are needed, the user can send 
                        it through e-mail to the author. With the aim of engaging users in the blog, the author 
                        will ask user to choose a topic of their choice, for the next blog entries. 
                        <br>
                        Readers satisfaction and the feeling of inclusiveness is the main goal of this website. 
                        The author encourages, readers to contact him even for the least of reasons.
